3.
    coded
4.
    the address should start at the next line of the jump occured.
    20
5.
    you can use j but not practical since it will be a one time use as doing so 
    will eventually have lack of use afterwards
6.
    Before the jump
    it is saved in ra
    the value of the address is in hexadecimal
    Yes
7.
    it will crash since 0 decimal is not hexadecimal
8.
    0x00400028
9.
    MODIFIED
10.
    0x00400028
11.
    we use the jal operator
12.
    saved

TPS 2
1.
    The output will be 38
    The output is 38
2.
    At face value, it acts the same as the c instruction
3.
    jump is not adequately saved. ra before sub is overwritten when jal sub is called
4.
    the x value is loss when it a0 was also used to sub function
    and also at line 25
5.
    the value x will be loss
6.
    fix
