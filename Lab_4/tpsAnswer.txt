TPS 1
1. I expect the print of 2 represented in hexadecimal
2. I expect it to be a character 'A' but represented in int
3. it printed 44434241
4. it printed 2. I am lost by this discovery
5. 
    a. one array was allocated in this program
    b. yes
    c. verified that it is true
6. Loop
7. Draw
    a. 
8. Loop
9. different increments of the address
10. the int is incremented by 4 while the character is incremented by 1

TPS 2
1. Line 8 creates a double pointer of size array so it means there is an array that each element points to another array
2. You access it by using *(array+i) where i is each index
3. *(*array+i)+j) is how you would use for arr[i][j]
4. verify
    We need to pass the size to know the limit of each array to print. Need to use for loop. The double array might be a different size than the single pointer array. 
    Not stored in C
5. compelete print array
6. modify
7. call
