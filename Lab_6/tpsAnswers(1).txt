TPS1
1. The starting for text segment is 0x00400000
    While the data segment is 0x100100000
2. The source shows actual register names rather than numbers that is use in Basic. Our code that was assembled initially
    The source is our code while basic is more operation shown rather than compressed.
3. For data segment, there is about 32 bytes different between each location
    For each value, there is 4 bytes difference or 32 bits.
4. There are 8 columns in each address, 8 words per row
5. Each address stores 32 bytes and each value is 4 bits
6. m:	.word 20
    and set that to a register
7. In data segment it is on address 0x10010000 at value +4 -> 0x10010004
8. str1: .asciiz "I love CSE31!"
9. It is at address 0x10010000 at +8,+c,+10 -> 0x10010008,0x1001000c,0x10010010
10. Each value store 4 bytes = 4 Ascii. 4 bits = 1 character. Lower address takes lower significance. The string is stored backwards
11. 
12 . la is load address of n which is in data segment which is 0x10010000 the same place as 13 and then lw loads 13 into t3
