1. Terminal Tab is at the middle-bottom of the screen in remote lab
    For my local machine, I just open tab on visual code studio
    a. You can open multiple tabs of terminals in remote tab and also visual code studio
    b. See different outputs of different files at the same time

2. the command is pwd to see what file it is the workspace sorround but dir tells which files are included by selection that looks like a book

3. configure workspace to direct it to desktop folder
    cd Desktop

4. create new folder called CSE31 and create a c or cpp file. When the file is opened
    it should have a directory of CSE31 for that file. -B also works on command line
    mkdir

    Searching up how to makefile would work also

3. gcc main.c -o main or make a make file

4. The compilation will be shown on terminal. If was is shown is 
    what you expect, then it is succesful. No errors, etc. Check bash history or use -g

5. -c is Compile and assemble, but do not link. Found in gcc --help in terminal

6. -g Produce debugging information in the operating systemâ€™s native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF). GDB can work with this debugging information. 
    for debugging purposes (https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Debugging-Options.html#Debugging-Options). Also known for to Generate debugging information

7.  -o flag

8. Shows an error that says "/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/Scrt1.o: In function `_start':(.text+0x20): undefined reference to `main'
    collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status"
