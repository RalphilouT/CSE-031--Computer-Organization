Assignment 1
1. What line caused the segmentation fault?
    The problem is line 18. The scanf expects an address for input but it is given a int. Which gives a bus error
2. How do you fix the line so it works properly?
    fix it by replacing scanf("%d", input) with scanf("%d", &input);
3. What is the bug here?
    The function is not returning the new sum but is using the sum in main which is zero. That is why the average outputs zero.
4. How do you fix it?
    To fix this, you can use pointer to be able to change the value of the sum out of the main.
    double * esum = &sum;
    and use esum for the parameter argument
    Make use to dereference sum in the read_value function to change the value of sum in the main function

Assignment 2
1. The output for those input is HELLO!hello!llo! therefore it was not expected as it should be HELLO!hello!. It didn't have a null pointer at the end
2. The output for those input is HI!hi!hellhi! therefore it was not expected as it should be HI!hi!. Is didn't have a null pointer and it was using the same array.
3. The output for those input is Hello! HowI am fine, thank you!I am fine, thank you!xs and some ?? symbols. Size of the string might be affecting this result/output
