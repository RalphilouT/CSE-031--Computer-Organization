TPS 1
1.
    Heap - dynamic storage (malloc()) 
    Static - global variable storage, basically permanent, entire program run
    Stack - local variable storage, parameters, return address
2. 
    a. 3 variable is declared
    b. 2 pointers are declared and ptr points to an int and a pointer to a pointer that point to an int
    c. num/ptr/handle is stored in stack
    d. ptr will point to heap memory
3. drawing 
4. drawing

TPS 2
1. creates a node (linklist style) that contain two values and a pointer to the next node in the heap
2. the head/struct is stored in heap since it used malloc
3. You need to create another node using the same method as head and use next to point at the newly created node. They must be in malloc also.
