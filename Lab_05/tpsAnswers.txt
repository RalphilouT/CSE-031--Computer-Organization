TPS 1
1. MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator
2. Download mars and/or java
3. In assignment page
4. 
    a. Run it by dropping down file and open file
    b. You drop down run and can be assembled
    c. you click wrench to run
    d. yes
    e. You click the button with the green and one next to it
    f. you stop and do the same thing

TPS 2
1.
    a. .data - subsequent items stored in data segments at next available address
    b. .word - 13 store the listed value(s) as 32 bit words on word boundary
    c. .text - subsequent items (instruction) stored in text segment at next available address
    The directives mean the following, .word is essentially creating some space in memory to hold data. Each item following it is 4 bytes long, 
    .text tells the assembler to switch to the text segment (where code goes), and .data tells the assembler to switch to the data segment (where data goes).

2.  line ten the two registers are the same then it will jump to finish
3. Jumps to fib like a for loop
4. When you run it, the execute tab will have breakpoints on the left side
5. You will need to click on the single step
6. right side has the content of the registers step by step or the end also
7. 0x10010000 in data segment
8. Input and output
    For this it is to print output for 19
    for 21, it is ending the execution
